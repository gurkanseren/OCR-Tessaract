# OCR-Tesseract: Image Text Extraction and Word Document Generation

This Python script extracts text from multiple PNG image files and adds the extracted text to a Word document using the `aspose.words` library. It is a wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR engine, which is used for optical character recognition (OCR).

#Code contains placeholders (load path, image path, output path-default). Replace acording to your own needs.

## Dependencies

Before running the script, make sure you have the following libraries installed, by running:

```bash
pip install aspose.words pytesseract pandas pillow
```
